### Recommendations from Previous Offering and Corresponding Changes

* Settle upon a robot platform [done]
* Improve the robot software to provide better examples of using objects. [done, although further improvement is needed and is ongoing.]
* Put Unified Modeling Language (UML) back into learning outcome 1j. [done]
* Consider re-adding content for more complex if-elif-else statements using and, or, and not to Exam 2 prep (add video and quiz)  [will do in 2018-19 fall]
* Move while loops into an earlier lecture day (Exam 3 prep) than Robot Drive Motors (use existing video and quiz)  [will do in 2018-19 fall]
* We currently do not teach the learning outcomes: f. Team roles  g. Conflict resolution. Either teach them or drop them from the course outcomes list. [under consideration]
* Make better use of the Code Reviews that Mark Hays pioneered.  [improvement is needed and is ongoing]

Long-term, consider the following:

* Develop some way to allow some students to work at different paces (perhaps as Math did with Calculus 1).
* Consider offering the material in smaller chunks than 4 credits.
* Consider using a language other than Python, that relates more directly to the languages that most students will use in the next 2 years of their study.
* Or consider using Python in 220.
* Revisit our goals for CSSE 120: What do we really want out of this course?
* The students who take CSSE 120 are now VERY varied (MEs, EEs, CPEs, BEs, CSs, SEs, and more). Are we meeting the needs of them all in an effective way?
* Should we do an intro to Matlab at the end of the course, for those whose next experience will be in that language?  Ditto Java?
* Determine whether changes should be made to provide a smoother gateway to CSSE 220.
* Could/should CSSE 120 be replaced by a (possibly self-paced) online course **even during the regular terms**?
	
### Learning/Course Outcomes (CO)

Students who successfully complete this course should be able to:

1. Analyze, explain and use appropriately in coding: Fundamental programming 
concepts including:
    a. Syntax and semantics
    b. Objects, types, variables, expressions, and assignment
	c. Branching control structures
	d. Explicit loops, both definite and indefinite
	e. Functions, parameter passing, user-defined functions
	f. Input and output, to both consoles and text files
	g. Sequences, including lists and strings
	h. Indirection, box and pointer diagrams and mutable objects
	i. Constructing objects, and using their methods and instance variables (fields)
	j.  Components of a class, as expressed in code as well as in Unified Modeling Language (UML) or other such diagrams
	k. Modularity and structured decomposition to break a program into smaller pieces
	l. Using an application programming interface (API)

2. Design, implement, debug and test small programs for solving problems motivated by real-world
interests, using the above concepts and modern software engineering practices including
(where appropriate, and at an elementary level):
	a. An appropriate integrated development environment with version control
	b. Coding to a specification
	c. Iterative enhancement
	d. Pair programming
	e. Test-first programming
	f. Documenting software, for internal readers and for external readers
	g. Use of application programming interfaces (APIs)

3. Work for 2 - 4 weeks in a team of 3-4 students on a small software development project,
demonstrating (at an elementary level) effective use of:
	a. Division of labor
	b. Integrating teammates' work
	c. Modularity and and structured decomposition to break a program into smaller pieces
	d. Constructing objects from new APIs as needed, and using their methods and instance variables (fields)
	e. Agile software development processes
	f. Team roles
	g. Conflict resolution

### Description of Assessment Tools

#### Every-session assignments

Each session has assignments to do _before_ the session and _during_ the session (and completed after the session as needed).  These include videos and reading, short quizzes, written exercises, and (especially) programming assignments.

These are required formative assessments that are checked for completeness by the TAs and instructors.  Occasional code reviews provide additional formative feedback to students.

#### Capstone team project

Capstone team project on designing and implementing a software product based on a given requirements specification.  Proceeds over 2+ weeks with regular milestones for deliverables.

#### Exams

Three exams during the term, plus a final examination.

Exams 1 and 2 include both a paper-and-pencil component and an on-the-computer component (with each component counting about 50% of the exam).  Exam 3 contains only a paper-and-pencil component, and the final examination contains only an on-the-computer component.

The final exam may be waived for students who have clearly demonstrated strong A-level mastery of the material.

#### Partner Evaluation Survey

A short survey students complete to rate themselves and their project partners on teamwork.

SUMMARY OF RELEVANT STUDENT FEEDBACK

Students clearly enjoyed the course and rated their learning at a high level. While a few complain about the workload, the majority consider the assignments to be one of the greatest strengths of the course.
	
INSTRUCTORS' SUBJECTIVE EVALUATION

Overall, the course was successful at meeting its objectives.

It remains the case that the course grades are bi-modal: Most students do very well, but a larger-than-desired fraction ends with a penalty grade.  It seems that these weaker students especially falter later in the course -- not that the material is harder or needs improvement, it is just that for these students, their weaknesses catch up with them at that point and there is no longer time for those students to catch up.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEXT OFFERING

* Consider putting all first-year women in a single section, or some other way to empower women in the course.
* Complete the move to the Lego robots for all sections, including further improvement to the library and materials.
* Consider re-adding content for more complex if-elif-else statements using and, or, and not to Exam 2 prep (add video and quiz)  [will do in 2018-19 fall]
* Move while loops into an earlier lecture day (Exam 3 prep) than Robot Drive Motors (use existing video and quiz)  [will do in 2018-19 fall]
* Improve the robot software to provide better examples of using objects. [done, although further improvement is needed and is ongoing.]
* We currently do not teach the learning outcomes: f. Team roles  g. Conflict resolution. Either teach them or drop them from the course outcomes list. [under consideration]
* Make better use of the Code Reviews that Mark Hays pioneered.  [improvement is needed and is ongoing]

Long-term, consider the following:

* Consider having a 'Green' (newbies) track section and 'Black' (some experience/fast learners) track section (Harvey Mudd model)
* Develop some way to allow some students to work at different paces (perhaps as Math did with Calculus 1).
* Consider offering the material in smaller chunks than 4 credits.
* Consider using a language other than Python, that relates more directly to the languages that most students will use in the next 2 years of their study.
* Or consider using Python in 220.
* Revisit our goals for CSSE 120: What do we really want out of this course?
* The students who take CSSE 120 are now VERY varied (MEs, EEs, CPEs, BEs, CSs, SEs, and more). Are we meeting the needs of them all in an effective way?
* Should we do an intro to Matlab at the end of the course, for those whose next experience will be in that language?  Ditto Java?
* Determine whether changes should be made to provide a smoother gateway to CSSE 220.
* Could/should CSSE 120 be replaced by a (possibly self-paced) online course **even during the regular terms**?
